The algorithm was ported to the iPhone by Success Software Solutions' Labs team. We used OpenCV's sample lkdemo application, and threw in some gui and video capabilities.

Please note that this is version 1.0 with several improvements still due. Generally 
these deal with:
* better visualization code in terms of FPS
* better frame extracting code for even more FPS
* some drawing eye-candy like drawing lines between close points, and such.
* Share on Facebook ;-)

we will discuss these in further detail in our forums:
